Thursday 8th October
First FYP Supervisor meeting
Prepared two slides, one explaining the problem, the other research to date.

Work done between meetings:
1) Found AI a modern approach and began reading into chapt 22-23
2) Further research into papers and context
3) Attempted to define the project a bit more, unsure if context analysis is just theme extraction etc
4) Read into Alexa slot context

Thursday 15th October
Second Supervisor meeting
Need to get to the base of the project
Define NLP on a low level, work with base techniques to get familiar
High level definition of context
Read into emotional project papers
Setup AIMA and work through some tasks
Write up of what the problem is
Write up background research to date
Project seems to be swaying towards emotion and context analysis of speech,
where we transcribe the speech to text, use NLP on text, use processing methods on the audio cues,
for a goal... I'm not fully sure about yet
