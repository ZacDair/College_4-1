A few useful commands for GDB debugging of C programs.

Firstly running GDB, requires *.o files (gcc -o output.o input-c)

Once open:

run -> runs program

Show and Set assembly language to read:
show disassembly-flavor 
set disassembly-flavor intel

disassemble main -> shows assembly code

break *0x----- -> set a breakpoint at that address

info registers -> shows contents of registers
c -> resumes the program
si -> executes line by line

We can also defines functions to save time with commands
define hook-stop
>info registers
>x/24x $rsp
>x/2i $rip
>end

hook-stop can then be used in debugging
info proc mappings -> shows state of mapped memory
